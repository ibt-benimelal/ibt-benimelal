👋 Hi, I’m @ibt-benimelal

👀 I’m interested in building scalable web applications, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring cutting-edge technologies in web development and cloud computing.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React patterns, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React-based front-end projects, full-stack applications using Java and React, and any innovative tech solutions in the web ecosystem.
